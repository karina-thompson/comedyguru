## 'Make me laugh' - Stand up comedian recommendations
******

This is the repository for https://comedyguru.herokuapp.com/ - a web app that recommends comedians to a user based on their comedian likes, and suggests similar comedians when an individual comedian is selected. Likes are saved for anonymous users using sesion storage and can be converted into fully logged in users. 

Still very much a work in progress and I take no responsibility for any comedian recommendations on the site - the data has all been randomised at this point!

#### Tech used

* Ruby on Rails
* jQuery
* Sass
* Materialize CSS Framework

I used this project as a way to start learning RSPEC and Test Driven Development.
